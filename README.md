ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi there! I'm a passionate and motivated aspiring software developer who recently completed the TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp. My curiosity about how things work led me to dive into the world of coding, and I've been having a blast building projects and solving problems through code ever since.

I have hands-on experience with:
- JavaScript for dynamic, interactive web development
- Node.js and Express.js for backend APIs and server-side logic
- React.js for building responsive, component-based user interfaces

I'm excited to continue learning and expanding my skill set into other languages and technologies, including TypeScript, Python, and cloud platforms. 
Currently, I'm seeking a Junior Software Developer role where I can contribute, grow, and keep leveling up as a developer. If you're looking for someone who's eager to learn, detail-oriented, and committed to continuous improvementâ€”I'd love to connect!
